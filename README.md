## Installation
This is for practice so I'm installing json package files via NPM(Node Package Manager) with no dependencies so as to activate the snyk VS Code extension. NPM can be installed via a download from https://nodejs.org/en or as I have installed it using NVM(Node Version Manager).

To copy my git starter files README.md + .gitignore run these 2 statements in the command line (you will need to install the wget module which I did via Homebrew):

wget -O README.md https://www.dropbox.com/s/8d05riwy7mb062p/READMETUT.md 
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/6l7rl93t4r5fvo5/.gitignore 

I started a local instance of git and pushed it to an empty repo on GitHub with the following commands:

git remote add origin remote_url
git push -u origin main

finally to cover the PHP interactions at the end of the video I run MAMP (free version)

## Usage
Strictly for practice.

Redoing this prior to doing more react work as it gives a good understanding of AJAX API in JavaScript.
