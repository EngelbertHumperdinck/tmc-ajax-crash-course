        "year": 1958, 
        "synopsis": "In 1764, the British come to an agreement with the native Delaware tribes in order to bring peace to the region. The Delaware tribes agree to stop their attacks on the white settlers and to relinquish all their white captives to the British. In return, the British promise to stop white settlers from settling on Delaware lands across the Ohio River and to cease slaughtering the natives. British Army scout Del Hardy, who once lived among the natives, serves as negotiator and translator for the British colonel Henry Bouquet. During the exchange phase, the Delaware tribes surrender their white captives to the British forces. Among the whites returning to civilization is Chief Cuyloga's adopted son, True Son, formerly known as Johnny Butler. With a heavy heart, Chief Cuyloga parts with his son and asks him to obey his white family once Johnny becomes a white man again. Despite his promise to obey his white parents and to integrate again into the white settler society, Johnny Butler has serious problems shedding his Delaware upbringing, mentality and behavior off. But firm guidance from scout Del Hardy and a loving heart from white settler girl Shenandoe seem to slowly win Johnny Butler back to his white origins."
